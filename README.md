# Better Netherite
A plugin that brings a few changes to 1.16s new Netherite.
Instead of the seemingly lazy way they made it, the upgrade system with the Smithing Table, you now have the option to disable that, and replace it with a crafting system that matches all other resources. And more features to improve it.

It is open source, but you may ONLY make changes and PRs to help improve the plugin. do NOT fork it and make your own, and claim it as your own, unless the plugin goes outdated for a long time, and you're updating it, in that case, credit me.
